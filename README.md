## Overview

My internship at Cyberark led me to develop this website-page as part of a study project.
The website shows NBA basketball players by year and team upon user's requests. Users can also create their own "dream team" edit and display it.

## Technologies

bootstrap@5.2.2, Type Script and Python (fastapi)

## Functionalities

1. Search - Receives a team name and year from user and return the players who played in the year of the given team name.
2. Is Active - Show active player only.
3. Statistics - Show player's statistics.
4. Add to my dream team - Add spesific player to user's dream team.
5. Remove from my dream team - Add spesific player to user's dream team.
6. Show user's dream team.
